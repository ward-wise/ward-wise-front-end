# Ward Wise Frontend

This is a refactored, reimagined, and expanded implementation of the current [Ward Wise frontend](https://github.com/ward-wise/alderman-spending-data-viz), built in Next.js.

## Setup

1. Clone/Fork the repo and install dependencies (`npm install`)

2. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html), if you do not already have an instance installed.

3. Run `createdb wardwise` in your terminal. 
> **Note:** If PostgreSQL was not added to your system PATH during installation, you'll need to be in the PostgreSQL `bin` directory for this command to work.

4. Create a `.env.local` file in your project directory and add the below, where USERNAME and PASSWORD are the credential for:
    * your system user
    * the user authorized to run Postgres on your machine, or
    * the **postgres** admin account setup during installation
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/wardwise?schema=public"
```

5. Run `npm run migrate:dev` to create tables and seed your database. If the seeding does not happen automatically, run `npm run db:seed`.

6. Run `npm run dev` to start a development server (located at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default)

For additional database management scripts, see `package.json`

### Google Analytics Setup

In the `.env.local` file, add a line with the following information:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID="G-#####"
```
The Google Analytics ID is obtained by setting the site up in [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).
